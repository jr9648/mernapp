The project provides a POC on turning any MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack application into a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) project using AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud-native tools. It outlines the steps involved in setting up AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy to automate the deployment process.

## Key steps covered include:

1. AWS Role creation for CodeDeploy and EC2 instance.
2. Launching an EC2 instance and configuring it.
3. Installing Docker and Docker Compose on the EC2 instance.
4. Setting up CodeDeploy agent and ensuring access to S3 storage.
5. Preparing existing MERN app source code, including setting up Nginx, creating Dockerfiles, and configuring Docker Compose.
6. Creating appspec.yml and buildspec.yml files for AWS CodeDeploy and CodeBuild.
7. Setting up AWS CodeBuild and configuring it to use the source code from GitHub.
8. Setting up AWS CodeDeploy and creating deployment groups.
9. Automating the deployment flow with AWS CodePipeline.

## Additionally, optional steps are provided for:
- Implementing a separate volume for MongoDB in docker for data persistence.
- Setting up an AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for application accessibility.

Overall, this project serves as a comprehensive guide for developers looking to implement CI/CD for MERN stack applications using AWS cloud services.
